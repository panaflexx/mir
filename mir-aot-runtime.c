/*
 * mir-aot-runtime.c - runtime support for ahead-of-time compiled MIR objects.
 *
 * The MIR x86-64 code generator lowers a few operations into calls to internal
 * "mir.*" builtin functions whose implementations are static inside the MIR
 * library and therefore not linkable by name.  When MIR code is emitted as an
 * object file (via b2obj), those calls become relocations and the helpers must
 * be provided by a real, linkable object - this file.
 *
 * b2obj maps the internal builtin names to the symbols defined here, e.g.
 *     mir.ui2f  ->  mir_aot_ui2f
 *
 * The implementations mirror the ones in mir-gen-x86_64.c exactly.
